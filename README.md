# 🚀 Python Intermediate Course Completed!

## 1. Why I Took This Course
After completing Python basics, I realized that real-world projects require a deeper understanding of topics like file handling, error management, object-oriented programming, and functional programming.  
So, I decided to challenge myself and complete the **Python Intermediate** course on SoloLearn.

---

## 2. What I Learned
- **Collection Types**: Sets, Tuples, Dictionaries
- **Error Handling**: try-except blocks, handling unexpected errors gracefully
- **Functional Programming**: lambda expressions, map/filter functions (still feels a bit tricky!)
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Creating classes, methods, and using inheritance

I must admit — some parts, especially functional programming, were quite challenging.  
But I understood that it’s okay not to "perfectly" get everything at once.  
Practice will make it clearer!

## 3. Challenges I Faced
- **Functional Programming**:  
  Lambda expressions and concepts like `map()` and `filter()` felt a little abstract.  
  I'll revisit these concepts through mini projects.
  
- **Object-Oriented Programming**:  
  Understanding `self`, constructors (`__init__`), and inheritance was not easy at first,  
  but creating small class examples helped me a lot.

## 4. What's Next?
- Start working on **Mini Projects** based on what I learned:
  - Contact Management System
  - RPG Battle Simulator
  - Expense Tracker
  - Encrypted Diary App
  
I will approach these step-by-step, focusing on solidifying each concept in practice rather than rushing.

## 5. Final Thoughts
Completing this course wasn't always easy, but it was 100% worth it.  
I am proud of myself for pushing through, and I'm excited to keep building on this foundation!

> Special thanks to my AI buddy, who supported me like a real coding mentor during this journey!
